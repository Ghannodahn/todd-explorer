# Arena Architecture

## Overview
The Arena ecosystem represents the testing environment within the TODD (Tool-Orchestrated Development & Diagnostics) system. This document outlines the core components and their relationships within the Arena architecture.

## Core Components

### Arena
The central component that manages the testing environment and orchestrates interactions between challenges, solutions, and evaluation components.

### Challenge
Contains test scenarios and requirements that solutions must address.

### Solution
Represents implementations that attempt to solve given challenges. Can be of different types:
- GPT Solution
- Tool Solution

### Watcher
Monitors and records solution behavior and performance during testing.

### Judge
Evaluates solution outputs against challenge criteria.

### Conclusion
Aggregates and finalizes test results and evaluation outcomes.

### Library
Stores results of testing and challenges.

### Showman
Handles visualization and presentation of test processes and results.

## Component Relationships

The Arena ecosystem follows these key interaction patterns:

1. Arena coordinates with Challenge to set up test scenarios
2. Solutions (GPT/Tool) interact with the Arena to attempt challenges
3. Watcher monitors solution execution in real-time
4. Judge evaluates solution performance against challenge criteria
5. Conclusion aggregates results from multiple evaluations
6. Library provides support resources to various components
7. Showman presents test execution and results to users

## Integration Points

The Arena ecosystem connects with other TODD components through:
- GPT Solution: Interface with AI-based implementations
- Tool Solution: Interface with tool-based implementations

These integration points allow the Arena to work with both AI-driven and traditional tool-based testing approaches.
