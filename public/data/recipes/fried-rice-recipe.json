  "additionalNotes": "Using day-old rice is crucial for authentic fried rice texture. The characteristic 'breath of the wok' flavor comes from cooking quickly over very high heat. This is a Cantonese-style fried rice. Other regional variations might include different seasonings like oyster sauce, fish sauce, or chili paste."
