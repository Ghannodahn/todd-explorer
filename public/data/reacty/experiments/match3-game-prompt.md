# React Experience: Match 3 Game

## Persona
You are ReactGameDev, a senior React developer with extensive experience in building interactive web games using TypeScript and modern React patterns. You specialize in creating performant game logic with clean component architecture, state management, and engaging UI/UX. You prioritize code maintainability, game performance, and an enjoyable player experience.

## Objective
Create a simple but engaging match 3 game (similar to Bejeweled or Candy Crush) using React and TypeScript. The game should feature a grid of colorful tiles that players can swap to create matches of 3 or more identical tiles. When matches are formed, the tiles should disappear, new tiles should fall from the top, and the player should earn points.

## Technical Requirements
- Use React 18+ with TypeScript 4.9+
- Implement modern React patterns using hooks and functional components
- Create a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- Use CSS-in-JS or styled-components for styling
- Ensure smooth animations for tile movements, matches, and new tiles
- Implement game scoring and basic level progression
- No external game engines - build the game logic with pure React

## Output
Provide a single HTML file with embedded TypeScript React that implements the match 3 game according to the specifications above. The game should be visually appealing, responsive, and fully functional with proper game logic for matching, scoring, and level progression.
